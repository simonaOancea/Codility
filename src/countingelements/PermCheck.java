 *A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

For example, array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
is a permutation, but array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
the function should return 1.

Given array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
the function should return 0.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

        for(int i= 0; i< A.length; i++){
            if (A[i] < 1 || A[i] > A.length) {
                // out of range
                return 0;
            }
            else if(counter[A[i]-1] == 1) {
                // met before
                return 0;
            }
            else {
                // first time meet
                counter[A[i]-1] = 1;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
